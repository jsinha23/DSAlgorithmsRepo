To Anil:
-----------------

Question:1 Sort the array using Merge Sort
Question 2: Find whether an array is subset of another array 
Question 3:Given a square matrix, turn it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.
Question 4:1) Given input as k sorted arrays, generate a single sorted list as output.
Eg:
Array1: 1 5 8 9 11 ….
Array2: 2 12 24 44 …..
.
.
Arrayk: 3 15 79 115 ….
Output: Array1: 1 2 3 5 8 9 11 12 15 ….
Question 5:Quicksort technique

To Jyoti:
---------------
1. Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space
2. Divide an array into k segments to maximize maximum of segment minimums
  Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 5}  
        k = 2
  Output: 5
  Explanation: There are many ways to create 
  two segments. The optimal segments are (1, 2, 3)
  and (6, 5). Minimum of both segments are 1 and 5, 
  hence the maximum(1, 5) is 5.
3. Pairs with Difference less than K
  Input : a[] = {1, 10, 4, 2}
        K = 3
  Output : 2
  We can make only two pairs 
  with difference less than 3.
  (1, 2) and (4, 2)
4. Find all missing elements in an array
   ex: {1,2,4,5,9}, length : 10
5. Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

  Examples:  

  Input: arr[]   = {2, 0, 2}
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  The structure is like below
