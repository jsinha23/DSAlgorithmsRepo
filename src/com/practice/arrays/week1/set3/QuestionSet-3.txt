-----------------
1.Check given matrix is magic square or not
2.Count sub-matrices having sum divisible ‘k’
3.XOR of numbers that appeared even number of times in given Range
Given an array of numbers of size N and Q queries. Each query or a range can be represented by L 
(LeftIndex) and R(RightIndex). Find the XOR-sum of the numbers that 
appeared even number of times in the given range.
4.We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.
5.Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.
in time O(log n)
