To Anil:
-----------------
1.Check given matrix is magic square or not
2.Count sub-matrices having sum divisible ‘k’
3.XOR of numbers that appeared even number of times in given Range
Given an array of numbers of size N and Q queries. Each query or a range can be represented by L 
(LeftIndex) and R(RightIndex). Find the XOR-sum of the numbers that 
appeared even number of times in the given range.
4.We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.
5.Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.
in time O(log n)


To Jyoti:
-------------------
1. Divide and Conquer | Set 5 (Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication)
2. Implement two stacks in an array
3. k-th missing element in sorted array
  Input : a[] = {2, 3, 5, 9, 10};   
        k = 1;
Output : 4
Explanation: Missing Element in the increasing 
sequence are {4, 6, 7, 8}. So k-th missing element
is 4

4. Maximum number of partitions that can be sorted individually to make sorted
  Input : arr[] = [2, 1, 0, 3]
Output : 2
If divide arr[] into two partitions
{2, 1, 0} and {3}, sort then and concatenate
then, we get the whole array sorted.

5. Find minimum number of merge operations to make an array palindrome
  Input : arr[] = {15, 4, 15}
Output : 0
Array is already a palindrome. So we
do not need any merge operation.
