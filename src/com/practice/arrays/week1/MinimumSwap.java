Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together.

Input:  arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3}, k = 3
Output: 1

Explanation:
To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap
element '5' with '3' such that final array
will be-
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 6, 5}
